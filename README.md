# MADLINE-Neural-Network-for-Implementing-NOR
Stands for multiple adaptive linear neuron
It consists of many adalines in parallel with a single output unit whose value is based on certain selection rules.
It uses the majority vote rule
On using this rule, the output unit would have an answer either true or false.
On the other hand, if AND rule is used, the output is true if and only if both the inputs are true and so on.
The training process of madaline is similar to that of adaline
